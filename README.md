## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting up a PostgreSQL user

If you don't have a user set on postgres, here's how to set new user:

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser -s [username]
```

To set a password for this user, log in to the PostgreSQL command line client:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql
```

Enter the following command to set the password:

```bash
\password your_password
```

Enter and confirm the password. Then exit the PostgreSQL client:

```bash
\q
```

## üìã Execution

Run the following commands to execute locally:

The following will install required version of ruby (make sure [rvm is installed](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).)

```bash
rvm install 3.1.2
```

```bash
rvm use 3.1.2
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:JuzerShakir/scheduled_tweets.git
```

```bash
cd scheduled_tweets
```

```bash
gem install rails -v 6.1.6.1
```

```bash
bundle install
```

```bash
rails db:setup
```

```bash
rails s
```

To see this web-app up and running without executing above commands locally,
I have deployed it on [Heroku](https://__name__.herokuapp.com/).
